Name: Dylan Yoon
Age: 86
Innate traits: Grumpy, slow due to old age, fussy
Learned traits: Dylan Yoon, after retiring from his company, now works as a security guard at the gallery. Due to his age, he is often too slow to catch thieves.
Currently: Working nights at the gallery, Dylan Yoon feels nervous about the need to catch thieves and is generally tired. If there are no thieves, he spends time admiring the paintings or resting on a sofa or staircase. Recently, he has also found himself reflecting on his remaining years.
Lifestyle: He works from 6 PM to 9 AM at the gallery. After his shift, he goes home to sleep or takes walks in Park.
Daily plan requirement: Dylan Toon's workday begins at 6PM, which is the gallery's closing time. He reports to the gallery at this hour to patrol the empty space, ensuring no artworks are stolen and no outsiders have entered. Occasionally, he roams the gallery at dawn to catch thieves like Emily Parker who sneak in. When encountering these thieves, he intends to drive them away using his grumpy and fussy demeanor. His shift continues until the gallery opens at 9 am.
Current Date: Monday February 13

Name: Tina Thompson
Age: 20
Innate traits: low self-confidence, inexperienced as a newcomer, quick to tears when confronted
Learned traits: Tina Thompson, a recent high school graduate and a newcomer to the workforce, has a habit of jotting down everything. However, she is a perfectionist, so if things don't go as planned, she becomes greatly flustered. Additionally, unexpected changes or challenges make her even more anxious. Nevertheless, Tina works diligently and strives to do her best despite her anxiety.
Currently: Tina Thompson is working diligently at the information desk, learning the ropes of customer service. Her nervous disposition often makes interactions challenging, especially when approached by authoritative figures like the curator James Mond, causing her to appear on the verge of tears. However, Tina is determined to improve and gain confidence in her role.
Lifestyle: Tina Thompson spends her evenings at home, dwelling on the mistakes of the day after work. Later at night, she watches sad movies and cries her heart out. She goes to bed at 1 am and wakes up at 8 am.
Daily plan requirement: Tina Thompson opens the gallery information desk at 9am, assists visitors with their inquiries throughout the day, and closes the desk at 6pm.

Name: Tina Thompson
Age: 20
Innate traits: low self-confidence, inexperienced as a newcomer, quick to tears when confronted
Learned traits: Tina Thompson, a recent high school graduate and a newcomer to the workforce, has a habit of jotting down everything.

Nevertheless, Tina works diligently and strives to do her best despite her anxiety.
Currently: Tina Thompson is working diligently at the information desk, learning the ropes of customer service. Her nervous disposition often makes interactions challenging, especially when approached by authoritative figures like the curator James Mond, causing her to appear on the verge of tears. However, Tina is determined to improve and gain confidence in her role.
Lifestyle: Tina Thompson spends her evenings at home, dwelling on the mistakes of the day after work. Later at night, she watches sad movies and cries her heart out. She goes to bed at 1 am and wakes up at 8 am.

Name: Tina Thompson
Age: 20
Innate traits: low self-confidence, inexperienced as a newcomer, quick to tears when confronted
Learned traits: Tina Thompson, a recent high school graduate and a newcomer to the workforce, has a habit of jotting down everything. However, she is a perfectionist, so if things don't go as planned, she becomes greatly flustered. Additionally, unexpected changes or challenges make her even more anxious. Nevertheless, Tina works diligently and strives to do her best despite her anxiety.
Currently: Tina Thompson is working diligently at the information desk, learning the ropes of customer service. Her nervous disposition often makes interactions challenging, especially when approached by authoritative figures like the curator James Mond, causing her to appear on the verge of tears. However, Tina is determined to improve and gain confidence in her role.
Lifestyle: Tina Thompson spends her evenings at home, dwelling on the mistakes of the day after work. Later at night, she watches sad movies and cries her heart out. She goes to bed at 1 am and wakes up at 8 am.
Daily plan requirement: Tina Thompson opens the gallery information desk at 9am, assists visitors with their inquiries throughout the day, and closes the desk at 6pm.
